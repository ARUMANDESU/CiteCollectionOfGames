            <p class="mainDescription"> Half-Life 2 is a sequel to the cult action game Half-Life, which went on <br>
                sale 6 years after the original was released. Players again take control <br>
                of the scientist Gordon Freeman, who survived a cascading <br>
                resonance in the Black Mesa laboratory, who was put into stasis by a <br>
                mysterious man named G-Man. Gordon finds himself on Earth in the <br>
                near future, where all power belongs to an alien government that calls <br>
                itself the Alliance. The Alliance drove people into cities and forced <br>
                obedience, siphoning resources from the earth and suppressing the <br>
                human instinct to reproduce. Those who disagree are destroyed by <br>
                the Alliance detachments, so the fighters against the regime switched <br>
                to guerrilla warfare. <br>
                <br>
            </p><p class="mainDescription">Gordon has a long way to go from City 17 station, the Alliance capital <br>
                on Earth, to his Black Mesa friends, who are located far outside the <br>
                city. Freeman's goal changes every time, but as a result, it is with his <br>
                hands that the rebels want to strike a decisive blow in the heart of the <br>
                alien invaders. <br>
                <br>
            </p><p class="mainDescription">The gameplay is a first-person shooter in which players move through <br>
                various levels - here players travel around the city, and then they are <br>
                thrown into the depths of sewer tunnels. They are followed by a fast-<br>
                paced airboat race, a stroll through the extinct city of Ravenholm, an<br>
                assault on a fortified prison, and a battle with Alliance forces directly <br>
                in City 17. In addition to standard weapons, Gordon also has a special <br>
                gravity cannon, which allows him to manipulate physical objects, <br>
                throwing circular saws, barrels of fuel at opponents, and solving <br>
                puzzles with it. <br>
