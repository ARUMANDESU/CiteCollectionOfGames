            <p class="mainDescription"> The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a computer role-playing game based on <br>
                the series of novels "The Witcher" by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, <br>
                a continuation of the games "The Witcher" and "The Witcher 2: <br>
                Assassins of Kings". The final part of the trilogy. The player is again <br>
                assigned the role of Geralt, a witcher who kills monsters. After the <br>
                events of the second part, Geralt regains lost memories, and finds <br>
                himself at a crossroads. War is raging in the Northern Kingdoms, and <br>
                Yennefer, Geralt's girlfriend, unexpectedly returns, asks him to help <br>
                with the search for Cyril, the Child of Surprise, who can stop the <br>
                advent of the Wild Hunt. Geralt embarks on a dangerous journey <br>
                across the war-torn lands to find Ciri and crush the Wild Hunt once <br>
                and for all.. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
            </p><p class="mainDescription">Compared to the second part, the game has changed - the combat <br>
                system has become somewhat simpler and more thoughtful, the <br>
                Signs have become more useful, and Geralt himself now appears to <br>
                the players as a real monster hunter - a person who fulfills contracts <br>
                for the destruction of monsters. In addition to the main storyline, the <br>
                events of which unfold in three huge locations, Geralt can also explore <br>
                the Northern Kingdoms, helping people with their problems, or simply <br>
                Geralt, as well as the ability to quickly move between locations. In <br>
                addition, The Witcher 3 has several new mini-games built in, including <br>
                even a collectible card game. <br>
